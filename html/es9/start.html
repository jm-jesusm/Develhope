          <h1>Copyrighting</h1>
          <p>
            Copyrighting is a fundamental aspect of protecting creative works, providing creators with exclusive 
            rights to their original content. Automatic upon creation, copyright ensures creators can reproduce, 
            distribute, and profit from their works. Understanding key principles such as originality, fair use, 
            and duration is essential for navigating copyright law. By marking works, keeping records, registering 
            copyrights, and actively monitoring and enforcing rights, creators can strengthen protection and uphold 
            their integrity. In a digital age where content is easily shared, copyright remains a crucial tool for 
            fostering innovation, preserving cultural exchange, and ensuring fair compensation for creators across 
            diverse fields.
